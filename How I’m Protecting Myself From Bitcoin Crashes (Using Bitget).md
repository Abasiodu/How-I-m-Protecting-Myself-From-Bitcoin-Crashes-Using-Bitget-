## Lessons from the Last Bear Market:

- **😓 Mistakes & Losses:** Last bear market, my portfolio dropped 90%, but this time, I'm sleeping soundly.
- **🔒 Hedging:** I've been hedging with futures to protect my portfolio without selling coins.
- **📉 Shorting Risks:** Shorting can be risky if used for gambling, but I'm using it purely for hedging.
- **💼 Bitget Futures:** I use Bitget's futures platform (they sponsor me, but I've been using them for months).

## How to Hedge on Bitget:

1. **💰 Deposit:** Go to assets, deposit USDT (or other coins like BTC, ETH).
2. **🔄 Transfer:** Move funds to your futures account.
3. **💼 Open a Position:** Choose isolated margin mode, low leverage (1X recommended), and short BTC/USDT.
4. **📊 Manage:** Keep an eye on positions, consider setting stop-loss/take-profit, but I prefer manual monitoring.

## Key Takeaways:

- **🛠️ Hedging vs. Trading:** The goal is to hedge, not to trade wildly for profit.
- **⏰ Monitor Daily:** Hedging isn't "set and forget"; you need to adjust positions regularly.
- **🔗 Try Bitget:** Use my link for a bonus when you deposit.
